Hi, I'm George, but usually go online as @Balssh

I'm currently working as **Junior DevOps Engineer** at Intel Romania. I like trying out various things related to both programming and software in general. Among these, my proudest "achievements" are: 
- migrating my personal laptop to Linux, first on Arch (btw) and now on NixOS.
- switching from VSCode to NeoVim as main editor/IDE
- changing my approach towards programming from "have a bunch of preconfigured/complex tools, frameworks and/or workflows" to "try to understand the basics, build it from scratch at least once". This is mostly thanks to ThePrimeAgens' videos.
- starting contributing to OSS
